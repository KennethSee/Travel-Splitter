# Travel-Splitter
Web app that allows you to consolidate domestic or international travel expenses with friends.

## About
This app was created as part of my final project submission for Harvard University's CS50 course. The idea came from my frustration that there was no easy way to split costs among friends when traveling and aggregating them under a single currency.

## Technology
The front end runs on vanilla javascript, CSS, and HTML. The back end is built using Python and Flask, and uses SQLite as the database engine. Currency conversions are performed via API calls to [Exchange Rates API](https://exchangeratesapi.io/ "Exchange Rates API").
